        <h3>Todo App Flutter</h3>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Flutter, Firebase, Docker, GitHub Actions</p>
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building a Todo App: Designed and developed a Todo application with Flutter, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.</li>
          <li>Integrating Firebase: Configured Firebase Authentication for user authentication and Firestore for storing task data. Firestore provides a real-time database to synchronize data across devices.</li>
          <li>Using Docker: Created Dockerfile and Docker Compose to build and deploy the application. Docker ensures a consistent development and deployment environment, minimizing configuration issues.</li>
          <li>CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to build and release APKs. The pipeline includes steps for code checks, building the application, and generating new releases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved Development Efficiency: Used Docker to standardize the development and deployment environment, reducing environment configuration issues.</li>
          <li>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Ensured continuous development and release of the application with GitHub Actions, reducing response times and quickly deploying new releases.</li>
          <li>User-Friendly Interface: Designed a user-friendly and responsive interface, improving user experience. Used Flutter to create custom widgets and a visually appealing UI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>To-Do List Application</h3>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, Jenkins</p>
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a To-Do List Application: Designed and developed a To-Do List application with Flask and PostgreSQL, allowing users to manage daily tasks. Flask was used as the server-side framework, while PostgreSQL served as the primary database.</li>
          <li>Containerizing the Application: Used Docker and Docker Compose to containerize the application. Created Dockerfile to build the application container and Docker Compose to manage dependent services.</li>
          <li>Monitoring and Analytics: Set up Prometheus to collect monitoring metrics from the system. Used Grafana to visualize monitoring data, providing a comprehensive view of system performance and identifying potential issues.</li>
          <li>CI/CD with Jenkins: Set up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying the application. The Jenkins pipeline includes steps to build, test, and deploy the application automatically to the production environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Efficient Task Management: The application helps users manage daily tasks efficiently with a simple and user-friendly interface.</li>
          <li>Automated Deployment Process: Used Jenkins to automate the build and deployment processes, saving time and effort, ensuring continuous and stable deployment.</li>
          <li>Comprehensive System Monitoring: Set up comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, helping to detect issues early, optimize system performance, and ensure stable operation.</li>
